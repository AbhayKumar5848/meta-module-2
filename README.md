Assessment of the Metacrafter ETH Beginner Module

1. Welcome to the evaluation for the Metacrafter ETH Beginner Module! This test will walk you through the process of using Solidity to create a basic token contract that resembles an ERC-20.

2. Contents Table Overview Overview You will design a simple smart contract for the "Metacrafter" token in this assessment. There will be a name, an acronym, and a total supply for the token. To control the supply of tokens, you will put minting and burning functions into place.

3. Store public variables:

Token Name: Token Shorthand Whole Stock a mapping that links the token balances of addresses.

Tokens can be created and assigned to a specific address using the mint function.

To ensure that an address has enough tokens to burn, a burn function can be used to delete tokens from that address.
