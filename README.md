Metacrafter ETH Beginner Module Assessment

1 : Overview

Welcome to the Metacrafter ETH Beginner Module assessment! This guide helps you create a basic ERC-20-like token contract using Solidity. The "Metacrafter" token will include essential functionalities like minting new tokens and burning existing ones to manage the token supply.

2 : Getting Started

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.

Navigate to Project Directory:

Open the project folder on your local machine.


Usage
Creating the Token Contract
Compile the Contract:

Use a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle) to compile Metaassessment.sol.
Deploy the Contract:

Deploy the compiled contract on your desired Ethereum network.

Minting Tokens
Minting New Tokens:
Minting allows you to create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.


Burning Tokens

Burning Tokens:
Burning tokens means permanently removing them from circulation. This process requires verifying that the address has enough tokens to burn.
